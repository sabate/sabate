### Hi there 👋 thanks for stopping at my repo.

Security Architecture can be overwhelming. I'm trying to stay on top of my day-to-day following this:

- 📚 Learning from others without losing focus with the ocean of information available.
- 👷‍♂️ Technically generating patterns, the smaller the better.
- 👨‍💼 Learning from the **enterprise in equal measure**: to provide the best fit.
- 💼 Reusinng, updating and adapting those **artefacts** whenever is possible.
- 🏃‍♂️ Marathon in June "menos pastilla y más zapatilla". **Physical training** is part of the improvement strategy.
